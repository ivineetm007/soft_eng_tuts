# What is React?

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

**Why it is created**
Working with DOM elements comes challenging. In react, we can create components which will be coneverted to DOM automatically. Components help us write resuable, modular and better orgaized code.

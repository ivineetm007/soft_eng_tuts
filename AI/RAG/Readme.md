3. Retrieval Augmented Generation- Question-> Indexing-> Retrieval -> Generation

Document Loading

1. Stastical and ML representations-
   - Bag of words, Sparse representation, Search Method- BM25
   - Embedding, Dense representation, Search Method- kNN,HNSW
2. Process
   - Loading
   - Splitting
   - Embedding
